# Task 3 - Decision Tree Classifier

Welcome to my submission for **Task 3** of the Data Science Internship at **skill Craft**. In this task, I have built a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. I used the **Bank Marketing dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** for this task.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the **Bank Marketing dataset**, which contains demographic and behavioral data of customers who were contacted for a bank marketing campaign. The goal is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on features such as age, job, marital status, education, and previous contact information.

## Tools and Libraries used
- **Jupyter notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **Numpy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for building the Decision Tree Classifier

## Model Development
During the model development process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features as needed.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored the relationships between key variables and visualized the distribution of features.
3. **Model Training**: Built and trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** using the preprocessed data. Split the data into training and testing sets and evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the decision tree model using appropriate metrics and visualized the decision tree to interpret the results.

## Conclusion
This project helped to create a predictive model using a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on their demographic and behavioral data. The decision tree provided insights into the most important features influencing customer purchases, such as age, job type, and previous contact information.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
